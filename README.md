# Ampasamp
A minimal password sampler.

## Overview
This C# application will randomly sample compliant passwords from a file according to a _task_ specified as a JSON file. Multiple policies can be sampled at once at identical sample sizes. C# is used because I wanted to write this fast and use it from Windows.

## Licensing

## Resources
For password lists, [Daniel Miessler's SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) is an exceptional resource.
